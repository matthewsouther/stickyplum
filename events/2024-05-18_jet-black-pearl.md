Hailing from the Netherlands, the untamed and inimitable Jet Black Pearl spent many years in the south of France before settling in Portland in 2014. She has performed on more than a thousand stages all over the world.

Jet is a creator of alternative worlds filled with surreal humor and wry observations. Smartly wacky, her songs are a mad hatter's European party with a funky attitude. With her loop station, she records grooves and layers of flute, vocal percussion and harmonies while squeezing one hot accordion.
