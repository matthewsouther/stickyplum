Matthew Souther is a songwright, a piano hack, and a swirl of thematic contradictions. Exuberant and plaintive; bombastic and self-deprecating; paying homage to jazz traditions but compulsively irreverant -- his songs are paeans to complexity. Ever fond of folk idioms, willing to chase fool's gold, offering false pretenses, and indulging in anachronism, he offers his tunes with a wink and a nod, then offers a glimpse at something resembling humanity.
