The untamed and inimitable Jet Black Pearl from the port of Amsterdam spent many years in the south of France before settling in Portland, Oregon in 2014. She has performed on more than a thousand stages all over the world.

Smartly wacky, her songs in Dutch, English and French are a mad hatter's European party with a funky attitude. With her loop station, she records grooves and layers of flute, vocal percussion and harmonies while squeezing one hot accordion.

For this performance, Jet Black Pearl will be joined by Bill Athens on double bass. Come join us!
