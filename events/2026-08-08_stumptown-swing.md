Stumptown Swing takes audiences back to 1920's Paris, when gypsies with guitars, violins and upright basses made the leap from French musette to American "hot jazz" and kept Parisians dancing to this evocative new sound.

Tim Connell (mandolin) and Mike Burdette (guitar) of Rio Con Brio formed the group after nearly a decade of playing swing gigs with Portland's best acoustic musicians. They snapped up the hottest upright bass player in town, Keith Brush (Stolen Sweets, Pete Krebs Trio, Blue Cranes) and are proud to feature their long-time friend and collaborator, the absolutely pyrotechnic violinist, Ben Blechman.

Stumptown Swing performs a set of hot, cool and sultry classics, featuring swinging groove and gorgeous acoustic instruments played with intelligence and passion by four masters of their craft.
