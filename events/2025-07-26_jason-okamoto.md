Guitarists Jason Okamoto and Mike Burdette bring together their love of Brazilian bossa nova and French gypsy jazz in this exciting duo. The combination of Spanish classical and French steel string guitar promises an evening of beautiful melodies, driving rhythms, and lush tone. Veterans of several of the area’s most prominent Brazilian and swing bands—Rio Con Brio, Stumptown Swing, Django’s Tigers—Jason and Mike are happy to present their music in such an intimate setting.
