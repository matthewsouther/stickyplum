A pandemic-inspired quartet of all-stars, The Back Burners came together when live music dropped off the map in Portland. With concerts and tours cancelled, suddenly there was the time—and the need—for busy friends to get together and play music for the joy of playing music.

Huddled by the burn and glow of propane heaters, The Back Burners pursued their love of improvisation by crafting all-string arrangements of jazz classics and new original compositions. Led by the interplay of fiery violin and blazing archtop guitar, The Back Burners swing and groove and take the music and the listener to a higher place.
