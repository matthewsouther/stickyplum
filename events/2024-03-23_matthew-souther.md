Matthew Souther is a songwright, a piano hack, and a swirl of thematic
contradictions. Exuberant and plaintive; bombastic and self-deprecating;
paying homage to jazz traditions but compulsively irreverant -- his
songs are paeans to complexity. Ever fond of folk idioms, willing to
chase fool's gold, offering false pretenses, and indulging in
anachronism, he offers his tunes with a wink and a nod, then offers a
glimpse at something resembling humanity.
