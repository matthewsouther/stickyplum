The Tree People was recorded in a studio in the woods near Eugene, Oregon in 1979 and released locally
at coffee houses, concerts, festivals and record stores. The album was discovered by record collectors
around the world in this century and reissued, to international critical acclaim by record companies in
Japan and Spain. Guerssen Records of Spain reissued their 1984 album, Human Voices in 2009 and

and festivals in Oregon and Washington. The Tree People released their 4th album, "The Return of The
