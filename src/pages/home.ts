    <p>
      Started in 2023, <strong>Sticky Plum House Concerts</strong> are held in
      the Cully neighborhood of Portland, Oregon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Named for the small yellow fruit produced by the tree whose shade forms
      our outdoor stage area, these family-friendly concerts are intended to get
      people of all ages out listening to good music. Kids are free to listen or
      play with parent supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe kids should be exposed to great music of all kinds; parents
      should be able to see live music without hiring a babysitter; and artists,
      neighbors, and friends should have opportunities to come together, share,
      and have fun.
    </p>
    <p>All are welcome, with or without kids. We look forward to seeing you!</p>
